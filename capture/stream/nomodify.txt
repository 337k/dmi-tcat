This is a text file which shouldn't be modified.

The creation time of this file will be read by controller.php to test whether it should run an automatic update.
Such an update will only be executed at the same time of day as this file was originally created.
This ensures TCAT installations world-wide will not 'git pull' and update at the same time.
